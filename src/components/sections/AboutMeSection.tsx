                Hi! Iâ€™m Niels, a 21 year old frontend developer and designer from The Netherlands with a passion for creating functional and accessible web applications. I am currently doing my graduation internship for my bachelor in computer science at the University of Applied Sciences Leiden. Besides my studies I love to learn more about different parts of programming and frequently make vastly different side projects you can read more about in the Projects section.<br /> <br />
        I started programming during middle school by learning the basics of python and web development, eventually learning C# and unity for my final year project. Since then I started (and have almost finished) my bachelor in Computer science, here I have learned far more technology mostly focusing on frontend development technologies like React, Vue and Tailwind but i also dabble some backend technologies like Laravel and Express.js.
